# OSINT Tool Database

A structured, evolving knowledge base of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools used in cybersecurity investigations, threat intelligence, and digital reconnaissance.

This repository is more than a tool list.

It is my personal OSINT learning system and a growing cybersecurity portfolio artifact.

I built this to think like an analyst, document like a professional, and train myself to pivot like a SOC operator.

Each tool lives in its own file and is organized by investigative category to mirror real-world threat intelligence workflows.

## Why I Built This

Collecting tools is easy.

Understanding how and when to use them is not.

The goal of this project is to move beyond surface-level awareness and instead build:

• Deep understanding of OSINT capabilities  
• Clear investigative pivot logic  
• Practical analyst-style documentation  
• A reference system for SOC operations  
• A foundation for automation and scripting  
• Muscle memory for real investigations  

This repository forces me to study tools the way analysts actually use them.

Not just what they do, but how they fit into investigative flow.

## How This Mirrors Real Investigations

Tools are organized by investigation phase rather than popularity.

When an alert fires or an incident begins, analysts pivot in a pattern.

This structure reflects that pattern:

### Username Enumeration
Start with a username. Find footprint.

### People OSINT
Pivot from identifier to identity.

### Domain & Infrastructure
Map attacker infrastructure.

### Social Media Analysis
Identify behavioral patterns and relationships.

### Breach Data
Assess credential exposure and reuse risk.

### Geolocation
Add geographic and network attribution context.

### Correlation & Link Analysis
Tie entities together and visualize relationships.

This structure trains investigative thinking, not just tool usage.

## Documentation Standard

Every tool follows a consistent template to simulate real analyst documentation.

Each entry includes:

Category  
Purpose  
Access / Where to Get It  
Input  
Output  
Strengths  
Limitations  
Requires Account  
Typical Use Case  
Example  
Notes  
Tags  

This ensures:

• Operational clarity  
• Real-world relevance  
• Repeatable workflows  
• Portfolio-quality structure

## Tagging System

Tools are tagged for filtering and future automation:

#free  
#paid  
#passive  
#active  
#api  
#recon  
#people  
#domain  
#geolocation  
#automation  

Eventually, this will support script-based indexing and lookup.

## Roadmap

This repository is continuously expanding.

Planned development:

• Expand to 100+ documented tools  
• Build SOC-style investigation walkthroughs  
• Create pivot-chain diagrams  
• Develop Python-based search and indexing  
• Implement SQLite local database integration  
• Build a CLI tool launcher  
• Automate recon enrichment pipelines  
• Add case study simulations  

This will evolve from documentation into an operational OSINT system.

## Who This Is For

This repository is for:

• Students learning OSINT  
• Future SOC analysts  
• Threat intelligence practitioners  
• Anyone who wants structured investigative thinking  

And for me — as a daily training ground.
