# OSINT Tool Database

A structured, continuously evolving knowledge base of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools used in cybersecurity investigations, threat intelligence, and digital reconnaissance.

This repository is designed as both a personal learning system and a professional portfolio artifact.

Each tool lives in its own file and is organized by investigative category to mirror real SOC and threat-intelligence workflows.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to move beyond simple tool collection and instead build:

• Deep understanding of OSINT capabilities  
• Clear investigative workflows  
• Practical analyst documentation  
• A foundation for future automation  
• A reference system for SOC operations  

Every tool is documented using a standardized template to ensure consistency, clarity, and operational relevance.

## Categories

Tools are organized by investigation phase:

Username Enumeration  
People OSINT  
Domain & Infrastructure  
Social Media Analysis  
Breach Data  
Geolocation  
Correlation & Link Analysis  

This reflects how analysts actually pivot during real investigations.
