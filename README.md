# OSINT Tool Database

A structured, continuously evolving knowledge base of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools used in cybersecurity investigations, threat intelligence, and digital reconnaissance.

This repository documents tools by investigative category, explains what each tool does, outlines strengths and limitations, and provides real-world use cases to support SOC workflows and analyst decision-making.

Hosted on :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} as both a personal learning system and a professional portfolio artifact.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to move beyond simple tool collection and instead build:

• Deep understanding of OSINT capabilities  
• Clear investigative workflows  
• Practical analyst documentation  
• A foundation for future automation  
• A reference system for SOC operations  

Each tool is documented using a standardized template to ensure consistency and usability.

## Categories

Tools are organized by investigation phase:

Recon  
Username Enumeration  
People OSINT  
Domain & Infrastructure  
Social Media Analysis
