## Category
Domain / Infrastructure Intelligence

## Purpose
DNSDumpster performs passive DNS reconnaissance to uncover subdomains, DNS records, and hosting infrastructure associated with a target domain.

## Access / Where to Get It
Website: https://dnsdumpster.com  

## Input
Domain name  

## Output
Subdomains  
A records  
MX records  
NS records  
IP addresses  
Hosting providers  

## Strengths
Free and web-based  
Quick subdomain discovery  
Visual domain mapping  
No account required  
Good initial recon tool  

## Limitations
Manual use only  
No API  
Limited historical data  
Results may be incomplete  

## Requires Account
No  

## Typical Use Case
You begin with a phishing domain and want to quickly enumerate subdomains and IPs before deeper infrastructure analysis.

## Example

Input:  
example-phish.com  

Output:

mail.example-phish.com – 203.0.113.45  
admin.example-phish.com – 203.0.113.46  

This expands the attack surface and supports pivoting.

## Notes
Great early-stage recon tool.  
Often followed by SecurityTrails or Censys.  
Useful for quick footprint expansion.
