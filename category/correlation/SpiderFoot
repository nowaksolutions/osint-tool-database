GitHub: https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot  

## Input
Domain  
IP address  
Email address  
Username  
ASN  
Company name  

## Output
Correlated entities  
Associated domains and IPs  
Email addresses  
Breach indicators  
Social profiles  
Infrastructure relationships  
Visual graphs  

## Strengths
Highly automated  
Over 200 OSINT modules  
Local deployment supported  
Visual relationship mapping  
Excellent for broad reconnaissance  
Free open-source version available  

## Limitations
Can generate noisy results  
Requires tuning for focused investigations  
Some modules require API keys  
Automation may surface false positives  

## Requires Account
No for local use  
Some APIs require accounts  

## Typical Use Case
You start with a domain and want rapid automated discovery of related infrastructure, breached emails, and connected assets before narrowing scope manually.

## Example

Input:  
example-phish.com  

Output:

IP – 203.0.113.45  
Associated Domain – fake-login.net  
Email – admin@example-phish.com  
ASN – AS12345  

This provides fast campaign-level visibility.

## Notes
Excellent for initial reconnaissance.  
Best used before manual pivoting.  
Pairs well with Maltego for deeper visualization.
